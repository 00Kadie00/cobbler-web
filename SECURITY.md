# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Before version 1.0.0 this repository will have no supported version. Security concerns can still be reported via the means described in the paragraph below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability we would love if you could report this to cobbler.project@gmail.com. This address is under control of @SchoolGuy currently.

Please be aware that since this project is not professionally managed we may have a hard time fixing this by ourselves. The more details we get, the more likely it is that we can react to it properly.

Since there is no funding for Cobbler, we can't offer you anything but our deepest thanks for finding a security issue.

## Known problems
